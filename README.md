This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

You can try out the live application by visiting the **Deployments** section on GitHub. This allows you to see how the project works in action.

This project was created to demonstrate my development skills to a potential client.
As a starting point, I used the notes/Frontend_task_-_React.pdf file.
Who knows how far this journey will take me?
