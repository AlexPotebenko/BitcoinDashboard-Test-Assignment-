# CI/CD Adjustments for Vercel Action

- Need to disable auto-deploying triggered by pull/push events in Vercel dashboard.
- Disable building on Vercel, since builds are already performed in GitHub Actions.
- See [Vercel Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vercel-action) for more configuration options.
